This code is for an image saver bot, specifically for Messenger. After running the code, a new web browser would be created and you will be redirected to Messenger. A 60 seconds timer will start after the browser is created, please log in to your account, go to the chat you would like to save images, and click on the image. A prompt would then appear asking you if you would like to start the bot and how many images before the current image would you like to save. These images would be saved on a folder named "Saved Pictures" and will be a shortcut on your home screen.
